### Semiprimary Numbers

Kummer did not use the term "semiprimary number".
The notion, though unnamed, arises <chart:w3>[here]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf1.A30"
}.

Kummer is very terse here, giving no demonstration that such an $h$ can be
found, dismissing the question with "as is easily shown" (_wie leicht zu zeigen_).

Hilbert later would mostly "carry on the tradition" of dismissing this fact
as being too easy to deserve much demonstration; Hilbert showed a few steps,
but still left many steps to the reader. See our discussion of Hilbert's
rendition <notes:w4>[here]{
    "libpath":"ZB_notes.Pg369_2.Notes"
}.


In <chart:w1>[this step]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf1a.A20"
}, we are using a very common maneuver. We have two numbers,
$$@R = u + alpuur v$$
$$@S = u + alpuus v$$
with a common divisor, say $d | R$ and $d | S$, and we are using
the fact that any linear combination of $R$ and $S$ must then also
be divisible by $d$.

The trick is to find the right coefficients for the linear combination.
To obatin $@qnt alpuur - alpuus; v$ in this way is quite easy: this is
just $R - S$.

<qna:w2>[Question:]{
    "question": "How do you obtain $@qnt alpuur - alpuus; u$ as a linear
                 combination of $R$ and $S$?",
    "answer": "$@qnt alpuur - alpuus; u = alpuur S - alpuus R$"
}

# Hilbert vs. Kummer on FLT for Regular Primes

Kummer's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes was published in 1850,
appearing in the 40th volume of Crelle's Journal.
The paper was the third in a series of three papers published by Kummer in that volume.
In the introduction to <notes:w4>[the first of these papers]{
    "libpath":"Cr040_06.EngTrans"
}, Kummer indicated that he had already communicated the basic ideas of the proof
in a letter to Dirichlet, written some time before April 1847.

## Differences to Watch

### Symbol Use

Whereas later authors often deliberately use the same symbols as their
predecessors, there are also often exceptions. In the present case, the
reader has to bear in mind the mapping,

| Kummer | Hilbert |
|:-------|:--------|
| $@lam$ | $@ell$ |
| $@alp$ | $@zeta$ |
|        | $@lam = 1 - zeta$ |

being especially careful with $@lam$. In Hilbert this is $@1 - zeta$;
in Kummer, the corresponding number $@1 - alp$ has no name, whereas
for Kummer $@lam$ is the rational prime in question.

### "Actual" vs "Principal"

Kummer didn't yet have the notion of "principal ideals". For Kummer, complex numbers
were either "ideal" or "actual".

### Semiprimary

Kummer used the very same notion of semiprimary number that appears in Hilbert,
but he did not use this, or any other, name for the concept.


## Outer Structure

The basic structure of <chart:w1>[Hilbert's proof]{
    "group":"ZB",
    "view":"ZB.Thm168.Pf"
} is _mostly_ the same as <chart:w2>[Kummer's]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf"
}. The proof's most basic feature, the case split on divisibility by
the ramified prime ($@1 - alp$ in Kummer; $@lam = 1 - zet$ in Hilbert),
is present in both.

Meanwhile the most arresting _difference_ between the two ways of structuring
the proof is in that Kummer <chart:w3>[immediately reduces]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf.S50"
} to the case in which the cyclotomic integers in the supposed solution are
pairwise coprime, whereas Hilbert chooses to forgo this reduction. Why?
As we proceed, we will be examining the differences this makes, and pursuing
an answer as to why Hilbert might have made this choice.

### Kummer

Before getting to <chart:w5>[the proof proper]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf.{S40,S50,Cs1,Cs2,F}",
    "color":{
        ":olB":"Cr040_08.Pf.{S40,S50,Cs1,Cs2,F}"
    }
}, Kummer begins by bringing in <chart:w6>[those results]{
    "view":[
        "Cr040_08.Pf.{A10,A20,A30}",
        "Cr040_08.Pf.Cr035_16.Pg356_18.Thm",
        "Cr040_08.Pf.Cr040_07.{Pg127_30,Pg128_26}"
    ],
    "color":{
        ":olG":[
            "Cr040_08.Pf.{A10,A20,A30}",
            "Cr040_08.Pf.Cr035_16.Pg356_18.Thm",
            "Cr040_08.Pf.Cr040_07.{Pg127_30,Pg128_26}"
        ]
    }
} from prior works that he will need. He does not begin to use any of these, however,
until he gets into <chart:w7>[the two main cases]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf.{Cs1,Cs2}",
    "color":{
        ":olY":"Cr040_08.Pf.{Cs1,Cs2}"
    }
}.

Let's take a look at <chart:w8>[Case 1]{
    "view":"Cr040_08.Pf1"
}.
