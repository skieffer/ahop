# Toward an Art History of Proofs...

Welcome. This is a collection of [Proofscape](https://proofscape.org)
modules I am writing on various historical mathematical works, such
as Gauss's *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae*, Kummer's work on Fermat's
Last Theorem, and Hilbert's *Zahlbericht*.

For now it is a loose (and small, but growing) collection of
translations, annotations, explanations, and example explorer widgets
("examplorers"), written to provide help and clarification to
students of these classic works.

Eventually, and with the collaboration of others, I would like to see
these notes grow into the vision of an _"Art History of Proofs"_, as
discussed [here](https://royalroadmath.org/ahop.html).
