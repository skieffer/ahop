# AHOP

Welcome. This is a collection of Proofscape
modules I am writing on various historical mathematical works, such
as Gauss's *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae*, Kummer's work on Fermat's
Last Theorem, and Hilbert's *Zahlbericht*.

Originally, AHOP stood for _"Art History of Proofs"_
(as discussed [here](https://alpinemath.org/blog/ahop.html)),
but I decided that was too ambitious, so now it stands for artithmatical house
of pancakes. It's a collection of my own rambling thoughts on what is
interesting to me, from time to time, about certain proofs.
